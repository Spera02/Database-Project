# Database-Project

The repository contains work completed for the University of Miami's CSC 423 Database Systems final course project with Dr. Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido. 
The project was split into three parts, for which there is a corresponding report written with all the information required.
The final part also includes an SQLite program to implement the database.
